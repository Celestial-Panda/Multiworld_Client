Welcome to the Client implementation for the Wind Waker Multiplayer project! 
Please understand that the project is still under development. At times one aspect
may seem more refined than others, and that is to be expected.

### Set Up ###
1. Run the exe
2. Select "Join Room"
3. Select Multiworld or Coop
4. Your group should have the same Room Name

*Player Names are currently Disabled for Multiworld*

### FAQ ###
- Why doesn't X item get shared?
  - If the item isn't from a Chest, then it won't get shared.
- When will X check get added?
  - There is a massive process for adding in different check types, it will happen eventually, I promise :) 

### Current Plans ###
- Game Room Update to make the Client/Server process more secure, and more personalized.

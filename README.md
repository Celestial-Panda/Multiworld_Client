Welcome to the Client implementation for the Wind Waker Multiplayer project! 
Please understand that the project is still under development. At times one aspect
may seem more refined than others, and that is to be expected.

### Set Up ###

2. Open up your preferred shell and install the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Put the Server details into the `config.txt` in the root folder.
4. Click `main.py`

*WIP - You can enter a Testing Menu by running `testing.py` with any extra arguments.*

### FAQ ###
- Yes, nothing works! Welcome to the early stages of development.
